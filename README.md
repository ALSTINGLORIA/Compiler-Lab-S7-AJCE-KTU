# Compiler-Lab-S7-AJCE-KTU
A repo Consisting of Some of S7 Compiler Lab Programs (KTU)

## Programs
1. Shift Reduce Parser <br>
This program may not work in some situations but in most cases works. Also it does not tell the action which it performs, only displays the final result.<br>
2.First and Follow <br>
It is a very simple program for first and follow bu only works when grammar does not contain ephsilon sign.
